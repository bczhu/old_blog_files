##chapter 9
###Don't read this chapter: The limits of "I won't" power

人的思维有许多很奇怪的地方，当我们禁止自己去想某件事（white bear)的时候，我们会更难不去想它。People thought about it more than when they weren't trying to control their thoughts, and even more than when they were intentionally thrying to think about it, 这被称为 ironic rebound effect. 它能够解释很多modern frustrations: the insomniac who finds herself more wide-awake the harder she tries to fall asleep; the dieter who banishes carbohydrates, only to find himself dreaming about wonder bread and whoopie pies; the worrier who tries to block out her anxiety but gets drawn again and again into disaster fantasies; the job candidate who wants so badly to make a good impression is most likely to blurt out the very thing that makes the interviewer cringe; and the most homophobic men get the largest erections while watching gay porn.

所以压制想法反而会适得其反。它是和大脑如何处理the command not to think about something 有关的。It splits the task into two parts, one part of your mind will take on the job of directing your attention toward anything other than the forbidden thought. 这被称为操作者（operator), 操作者有赖于self-control and---like all forms of effortful self-control---requires a good deal of mental resources and energy. Another part of your mind takes on the job of looking for any evidence that you are thinking, feeling, or doing whatever you don't want to think, feel, or do.这被称为监督者(monitor).不像操作者，监督者是自动运行的，且不需要太多的mental effort，很多都是下意识的。

而我们的大脑被设计成，当我们更容易想到某事的时候，我们会更相信它是真的。但是，whatever fear or desire you try to push away will become more convincing and compelling，所以，很多时候，一些负面的想法，尽管时常浮现在脑海中，但并不是事实。

你越是压抑负面的想法，就越容易抑郁。那么该怎样去避免这种ironic rebound 现象呢？你要的不是控制自己不去想它们，而是放弃控制， let it be，paradoxically, permission to think a thought reduces the likelihood of thinking it.我们需要的是接受这些情绪和想法，但不要太信以为真。

有个很好的练习可以帮助我们。呼吸法。我们去感受自己的（负面）情绪，notice if you feel it in your gut, your chest, your throat, or anywhere else in your body. Once you've observed the thought and feelings, shift your attention to your breathing, imagine the thought and feelings like clouds passing through your mind and body. Keep breathing, and imagine the clouds dissolving or floating by. Imagine your breath as a wind that dissolves and moves the clouds effortlessly. the opposite of thought suppression is accepting the presence of the thought---not believing it.

所以，很多时候，dieters who suppress thoughts about food have the least control around food. There is little to no evidence for weight loss or health benefits of dieting, and growing evidence that dieting does harm. In fact, dieting is a better way to gain weight than to lose it. and science is now confirming that restricting a food automatically increases your cravings for it. 但是对于节食最后的失败,会被解释为 evidence that we didn't try hard enough to suppress---not that suppression doesn't work.

所以有个研究是提倡 the no-dieting diet， 有一个方案，the program doesn't hand out a list of forbidden foods, and it doesn't focus on cutting calories. Instead, it emphasizes how foods can create health and provide pleasure. It also asks participants to think about waht they can do to improve their health---like exercise---instead of thinking in terms of what they shouldn't do or eat.所以很多的意志力训练，我们可以改变策略，将"I won't"转变为"I will".
