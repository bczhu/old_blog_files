###Infected! Why willpower is contagious

我们人的本性就是“随波逐流”的(we are the lemmings our mothers always warned us not to be)，这来源于我们的社会性大脑，在原始社会中，若是大部分人在做某件事，则最经济和安全的方式便是随大众做同样的事情。所以很多时候我们的行为并不仅仅由自己控制，也会受到他人的影响，而受社会和环境控制。our individual choices are powerfully shaped by what other people think, want, and do-and what we think they want us to do.

而这种社会性的对个人行为的影响，就像是一场“流感”，具有很强的传染性。这种行为的流感不同于真正的疾病性流感在于，对于疾病来说，传染是直接性的，和对方是熟人或陌生人没关系，而行为“流感”却更多的是某种tribe行为，越亲密的人，传染性就越强。而这种流感同样是把双刃剑，不仅可以传播坏的行为习惯，也可以传播好的，例如意志力。

所以我们都是社会性的，the social self，并且这有很强的生物学基础。在大脑中，专门有种神经细胞叫镜像神经元，mirror neurons, whose sole purpose is to keep track of what other people are thinking, feeling, and doing, 这赋予了我们感同身受的能力。我们会自动去模仿他人的physical gestures and actions,他人的情绪，甚至是catch temptation when we see others give in, this is one reason we eat more with others than when we're alone, why gamblers raise their bets after seeing someone else win big, and why we spend more when shopping with friends.

我们是天生的读心者（mind reader）， whenever we observe other people in action, we use our social brains to guess at their goals. the good news is, goal contagion is limited to goals you already, at some level, share. the best way to strengthen your immune response to other people's goals is to spend a few minutes at the beginning of your day thinking about your own goals, and how you could be tempted to ignore them. when we observe evidence of other people ignoring rules and following their impulses, we are more likely to give in to any of our own impulses.

social proof and the power of model 很重要。我们喜欢呆在钟形曲线的中间。when it comes to social proof, what we think other people do matters even more than what they actually do.

社会性的情感，像骄傲和羞愧，比起像长期目标的付出和利益那样的理性思考，会更快且直接的影响着我们的选择。people who imagine how proud they will feel when they accomplish a goal are more likely to follow through and succeed. 而shame，在某种程度上，也会起到积极的效果，但是不能忽视 the what-the-hell effect. Anticipatory shame might be able to keep you from walking into the Cheesecake Factory, but when the temptaton is in front of you, it has no power over the promise of reward. 

实验表明，guilt decreases heart rate variability, while pride, sustains and even increases that. So we could go public with our willpower challenges. If we believe that others are rooting for your success and keeping an eye on your behaviour, we'll be more mtivated to do the right thing.这都说明了社会支持的重要性。
